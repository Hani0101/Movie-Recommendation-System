# Movie-System-Recommendation
-A small system that takes from the user a movie name, and it will recommend 5 different movies that are similar to the movie you chose:

-The GUI was built using Python Streamlit library

-TMDB API for the movie posters

-Pandas functions were used for accessing data from kaggle dataset, and Sklearn functions were used for doing the similarity calculations between the movies.
